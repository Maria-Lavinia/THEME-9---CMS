      <img src="IMG_F41A9E4D56E7-1.jpeg" alt="me" class="me">
        <p class="p_me">My name is Maria and I am a 19-years old Romanian girl in love with the world. I enjoy greatly exploring new places and creating new experiences. From a very young age my creativity has always driven me to new heights and has contributed to my development on a both personal and professional level. So here I am in Copenhagen, studying Multimedia Design at KEA.
        
        When it comes to Multimedia Design, what interests me the most is applying a sense of aesthetics and critical thinking in order to create a wonderful user experience for people. On a more personal note, I enjoy ballet, reading, long walks in the park with a good coffee in my hand and meeting new people.</p>
